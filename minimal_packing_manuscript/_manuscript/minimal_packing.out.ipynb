    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil is fundamentally a discrete material that is, nevertheless, commonly modeled as a continuum because of the computational expense of large-scale discrete element models (DEMs). Even at lab specimen scales, DEM’s computational cost may be substantial depending on the grain sizes being modeled. Dispite these limitations, discrete models have proven useful in furthering our understanding of soil mechanics because they can spontaneously replicate realistic soil behavior as an emergent macro-scale property from a collection of particles following relatively simple interaction rules. This makes DEM an attractive tool for a multi-scale modeling approach where the constitutive behavior of a representative volume element (RVE) is characterized with a discrete model and applied at a larger scale through a continuum model. The ability of the RVE to represent a soil depends strongly on an appropriate grain size distribution match. However, in order to achieve computationally feasible models, even at lab scales, DEM simulations often use larger minimum particle sizes and more uniform distributions than their intended targets. Intuitively, discrete matches of different grain size distributions (GSDs) will require vastly different numbers of particles. But the precise relationship between GSD characteristics and the number of particles needed to match the distribution (and by extension the associated computational cost associated) is not intuitive. In this paper, we present the minimal packing set (MPS) concept. The minimal packing set is the smallest set of discrete particles needed to match a given GSD. We present a method for determining the MPS for any GSD and discuss strategies for finding the smallest MPS within a set of tolerances on the GSD. When mapped onto USCS classifications, A mapping of MPS onto USCS classification reveals a highly non-linear relationship between soil classification and computational cost of DEM modeling across several orders of magnitude.\n",

    "Intro text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil is discrete. Several frameworks use discrete approaches, but they’re difficult to manage and expensive to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "But mechanics is mechanics and you can’t model something well that doesn’t replicate its underlying physical behavior. If you can replicate the underlying mechanisms, the macro-scale behavior should emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RVE concept is somewhat tied to grain size distribution (but not completely).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a grain-size distribution? How can it be described mathematically? How precise does a GSD need to be and how would one even measure that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which features of a GSD contribute to more or less computationally intense models?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical GSD\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we need to create rigorous mathematical definitions for soil samples, sieve stacks, and a grain size distribution. Conceptually, each of these are collections of items (i.e., sets) with specific restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples are collections of particles. For the purposes of this paper, assume that particles are spherical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample S:** $$S = \\{(x_i, q_i) : i \\in I_S\\}$$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_S = \\{x_i : i \\in I_S\\}$ with $x_1 < x_2 < \\cdots < x_{n_S}$ (ordered sizes)\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q = \\{q_i : i \\in I_S\\}$ (corresponding quantities)\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^+$ and $Q \\subset \\mathbb{Z}^+$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grain Size Distribution G:** $$G = \\{(x_j, v_j) : j \\in I_G\\}$$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_G = \\{x_j : j \\in I_G\\}$ with $x_1 < x_2 < \\cdots < x_{n_G}$ (ordered sizes)\n",

    "\n",
    "$X_G \\subset \\mathbb{R}^+$ and $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^+$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completeness Condition for G:** A grain size distribution $G$ is **complete** if and only if: $$v_{n_G} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updated Comparison Conditions** (G describing S):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition 1:** $G$ describes $S$ if $\\min(X_G) < \\min(X_S)$ and $\\max(X_G) \\ge \\max(X_S)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition 2:** $G$ describes $S$ efficiently if $\\forall (x_j, x_{j+1})$ consecutive in $X_G$, $\\exists x_i \\in X_S$ such that $x_j < x_i \\le x_{j+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition 3:** $G$ describes $S$ articulately if $\\forall (x_i, x_{i+1})$ consecutive in $X_S$, $\\exists x_j \\in X_G$ such that $x_i \\le x_j < x_{i+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition 4:** $G$ describes $S$ accurately if for all consecutive pairs $(x_j, x_{j+1})$ in $X_G$: $$v_j = \\sum_{\\substack{i \\in I_S \\\\ x_j < x_i \\le x_{j+1}}} q_i \\cdot f(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f(x)$ is a scaling function that converts size to volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, we use masses, rather than volumes in grain size distributions. Assuming the particles are of the same density, we can add a mass component to $G$ by multiplying $V$ by the density, $\\rho$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete grain size distribution, we can also define a percentage (most often by mass), $\\Lambda$, for each size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions above are focused on how $G$ describes $S$, but in reality, we develop grain size distributions from direct measurement of samples. The question at hand is how to generate a sample that is a good match to a known grain size distribution. We can say that $S$ matches $G$ if $G$ accurately describes $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that conditions 1, 2, and 4 are often met in laboratory testing, while condition 3 is practically impossible to meet in the lab, but easily met in discrete element simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving for the minimal packing set\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the simple case where G describes S efficiently and articulately (i.e., there is one and only one particle size retained on each sieve).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uniform particle sizes in each sieve\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a single particle size to represent all possible particle sizes between two sieve sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Representative radius\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a bin with a lower limit of radius, $r_{low}$ and an upper limit of radius $r_{high}$. The distribution of the number of particle radii within the bin is given by a probability density function, $P(r)$. Selecting a “representative” value for the bin, $r_{rep}$ would likely involve some measure of the average particle size, either by radius or volume. A representation based on volume is more appealing since the overall GSD is volume-weighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In absence of any other reason to suspect a specific distribution, a uniform distribution seems like a reasonable choice. Under a uniform distribution of radii, the mean radius would be the average of $r_{low}$ and $r_{high}$. The radius at the mean volume of this same distribution would given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{rep} = r_{low} + \\frac{r_{high}-r_{low}}{p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is between $\\sqrt[3]{4}$ and 2 and $\\frac{r_{low}}{r_{high}}$ is between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "These come from the range of possible differences between the radius associated with the mean volume and the mean radius. If $\\frac{r_{low}}{r_{high}}$ is zero, there is no lower limit to the range (i.e., $r_{low}$ is infinitely small), $r_{mean} = r_{high}/2$, and the mean volume will be $\\frac{\\pi r_{high}^3}{3}$. The radius associated with the mean volume in this case is $\\frac{r_{high}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$. This corresponds to $p = \\sqrt[3]{4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\frac{r_{low}}{r_{high}}$ *approaches* one, the difference between $r_{low}$ and $r_{high}$ becomes very small and the radius associated with the mean volume approaches the mean radius. This corresponds to $p = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\frac{r_{low}}{r_{high}}$ is one, there is no difference between $r_{low}$ and $r_{high}$ (i.e., there is no variation in radii), and the mean volume will be $\\frac{4\\pi r_{high}^3}{3}$. The radius associated with the mean volume in this case is simply $r_{high}$. This corresponds to an indeterminate condition for $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can use the following equation to select an appropriate value of $p$ to describe a volume-based representative radius for a uniform distribution of particles between $r_{low}$ and $r_{high}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\frac{r_{low}}{r_{high}}) = (2-\\sqrt[3]{4})\\frac{r_{low}}{r_{high}} + \\sqrt[3]{4}$$\n",

    "#### Particle quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a grain size distribution $G$ of spherical particles, the minimal packing set, $S_{mp}$ is the smallest sample (i.e., minimizing $||S||$) that provides a sufficiently good match to $G$. The number of sizes in $S$ will be $n_G - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to match the $G$, we need to fully capture the relations between the particle sizes in terms of ratios of: total mass, individual particle mass, and number of particles. These ratios can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Phi = \\{\\frac{m_j}{m_{n_G}} : j \\in I_G\\} \\text{; with elements } \\phi_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Xi = \\{\\frac{x_j^3}{x_{n_G}^3} : j \\in I_G\\} \\text{; with elements } \\xi_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = \\{\\frac{\\phi_j}{\\xi_{n_G}} : j \\in I_G\\} \\text{; with elements } \\upsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\Phi$, $\\Xi$, and $Y$ are all ratios, they can be described as fractions of integers. This can be accomplished in several ways but my preferred approach is to convert all the entries in $G$ to integers by multiplying them by multiples of the inverse of their smallest elements. Once all the entries in $G$ are integers, $\\Phi$, $\\Xi$, and $Y$ will automatically be fractions of integers. By finding the least common multiple of all the denominators of the fractions in $Y$, we can identify the quantities needed to for\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantities needed to produce $S_{mp}$ can then be found by multiplying $Y$ by the least common multiple of the denominators of the fractions in $Y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = Y \\cdot \\text{lcm}\\{d_i : \\frac{n_i}{d_i} \\in Y\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If desired, the number can be reduced if some tolerable error is allowed. An alternative quantity set can be generated by iteratively multiplying $Y$ by every integer between 1 and $\\kappa$, finding the closest integer representation of the product, and comparing this result to the allowable tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed particle sizes in each sieve\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to reducing the number of particles in $S_{mp}$ is to allow an arbitrary number of sizes between the sizes in $G$. In other words, we will find the smallest $S$ such that $G$ describes $S$ accurately and efficiently, but not articulately. This represents a more realistic model of laboratory test results. But we don’t need to identify all the sizes. In fact, for any distribution of sizes in a range, we can find a single size that can represent the same mass with the same number of particles. Because multiple sizes can exist between sizes in $G$, we need to expand the definition of $\\Phi$ to include the combination of ratios of minimum and maximum particle sizes (four possible combinations – min/min, min/max, max/min, max/max).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then follow the iterative procedure described in the previous section except that now, we multiply the expanded $Y$ and check wether the four fractions at each index *span* or are equal to an integer. When they do, these integers are $Q$. However, now the sizes in $S$ are unknown. But we can find the ratio of the sizes as:\n",

    "$$P = \\sqrt[3]{\\Phi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*I haven’t confirmed this, but I have the sense that the information in the last element in the expanded $\\Phi$ will tell you something about the size of the largest particle.*\n",
    "\n",
    "By testing different samples with size ratios $P$ and $x_{nG}$ between its min and max value, we can find the value of $x_{nG}$ that creates a sample that is accurately and efficiently described by $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*I think there might be a problem with just finding whether there’s an integer among the four elements in $\\Phi$. I think there needs to be an integer between all entries with the same denominator. If the criteria is met with the min in the *"
